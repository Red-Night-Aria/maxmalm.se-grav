s:712:"<p>My last post was about how to get Ionic up and running manually. It's not a good method to get started with Ionic and it just takes time and unnecessary troubleshooting. This solution works with Windows, OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Now I'm using my own fork of the official vagrant box: ionix-box</p>
<p>It's easy to get started with:</p>
<p>Install Virtualbox, Vagrant and Git Bash (for Windows) then run</p>
<p><code>$ git clone https://github.com/benjick/ionic-box</code></p>
<p><code>$ cd ionic-box</code></p>
<p><code>$ vagrant up</code></p>
<p>And boom, you can now develop Ionic apps in a Linux environment (currently based on Ubuntu 14.04).</p>
