s:1329:"<p>Yesterday I started my trial run with Joylent to see how my body reacts to it. For now I'm going to eat Joylent as my primary food source for 9 days coupled with whey protein after workouts. The plan is to do this trial run for 9 days, see how I feel and if I feel good enough I'm going to take a break then do it for 30 days. </p>
<p>Joylent (a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_%28drink%29">Soylent</a>) is a nutrional drink containing 100% of the daily intake of everything. Each bag of powder contains 2119 kcal and it's recommended to eat in three meals. I'm going to do this with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting">intermittent fasting</a> for two meals. Half after work and half after workout.</p>
<p>Should these 9 days go well I'm planning the following for the 30 days:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong>: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein<br />
<strong>Tuesday</strong>: IF meals. Some light walking.<br />
<strong>Wednesday</strong>: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein<br />
<strong>Thursday</strong>: IF meals. Some light walking.<br />
<strong>Friday</strong>: Workout (SL 5x5). IF meals and whey protein<br />
<strong>Saturday</strong>: Three meals of Joylent spread out over the day<br />
<strong>Sunday</strong>: IF meals. Some light walking.</p>";
