s:3769:"<p>Yesterday Heroku announced the good bye to free tier as we know it. The short story is, free tier was abused by people pinging their dynos to stay alive 24/7 (they went to sleep after an hour of inactivity before), and now they introduced a hobby tier which is basically the same as the old free tier (without the sleep) for $7 a month. Pretty good deal, but I already have so much server power on premise that I feel I can't insist on paying another provider to host my stuff.</p>
<p>I started thinking about how I could set up my own cluster, looking at talk on Docker, Kubernetes and Mesos. It all seemed a bit over my head. It all looked great but I couldn't really find any resources where to begin, where to put down the shovel and dig. The talks went in-depth and over my head, so many terms I haven't heard of before. Then in a comment someone mentioned it.</p>
<p>Today I met Flynn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throw away the duct tape. Say hello to Flynn.</p>
<p>Flynn fixes everything that's wrong with the process of deploying, scaling, and managing your applications. So they run the way they're supposed to â€“ with ease. And you can do more of what you want to do and less of what you have to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what Flynn promises when you reach https://flynn.io/</p>
<p>I guess you could say Flynn is your own Heroku hosted by you. Your own PaaS on premise or in the cloud. Why I make the Heroku comparsion is because I come from Heroku to Flynn, but that's not all:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Heroku buildpacks <code>BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git</code></li>
<li>Deploying with git is a thing with Flynn - <code>git push flynn master</code></li>
<li>Pull repositories from your Github account with a read only token (see screenshot further down below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deploy a Meteor application to Flynn</h2>
<pre><code>meteor create --example todos
cd todos
git init
git add .
git commit -m "partytime"
flynn create todos
flynn env set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse.git
flynn env set MONGO_URL=mongodb://xxx:yyy@ds039078.mongolab.com:39078/heroku_app000000
flynn env set ROOT_URL=http://todos.your.cluster.domain
git push flynn master</code></pre>
<p>And like that it's done, your app is running on Flynn. It even supports sticky sessions if you want to run it on multiple containers.</p>
<pre><code>flynn route add http -s todos-web --sticky mydomain.com
flynn scale web=3</code></pre>
<p>From the docs (https://flynn.io/docs/cli#route):<br />
<code>--sticky</code> enable cookie-based sticky routing (http only)</p>
<p>I will try this with https://github.com/meteorhacks/cluster when I have the time</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I moved one of my less business critical application to Flynn, a Meteor app for controlling our digital signage screens, and it works really well. A few kinks had to be sorted out, but most problems was due to me not reading the docs good enough. Flynn doesn't have a MongoDB component yet (there's only a postgres for now) so I took the moment to try out MongoDB MMS and deploy a cluster on promise. All in all it took a few hours from the starting to read about Flynn to deployed app.</p>";
